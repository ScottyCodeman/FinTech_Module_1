### 1. Borrowell is trying to make financial prosperity possible for everyone by providing: Credit monitoring, education, and product recommendations.
### 2. Their audience is around 59% male and 40% female with the largest of the group being in the 25 -34 age range.
### 3. The unfair advantage they have is that they are one of the earliest to market with AI-Coaching (**Molly**) 
### 4. They use jQuery, php, cloudFlare, Microsoft Azure, Slick, and handlebars.js for Application and Data.
###    They use Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Optimizely, Hotjar for Ultilities.
###    They use gmail, Wordpress, Googlefonts, Font Awesome, Unbounce as Buisness Tools.

### 1. Borrowell is a Fintech Company in the Invesetment industry as well as offering credit checks and loans.
### 2. Their are four tends over the last 5 years into the future.

## Results

> * What has been the business impact of this company so far?

> * What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

> * How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

### 1. Helping the Canadian economy by investing time in helping small buisnesses. And providing their combined financial expertise and technology to help people get captial.
### 2. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Market Multiple Methods along with Revenue (borrowell has a Revenue of $21.7 million) are good ways to measure success, however the first two arent easily accessible.
### 3. Borrowell is performing near the top 21st in the Gobal market compared to similar companies.


## Recommendations

> * If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

> * Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

> * What technologies would this additional product or service utilise?

> * Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
### I would want them to start a program called " Get back to Zero ". It would reinforce the fact that a lot of people could use the help of their AI-Coach to get out of debt.
### It would then make them more accessible and open their market share to an even lower age group.
### Similar technologies to what they have in place now, but focusing the *Machine Learning* on getting people out of debt and ways to save.
### they give people the attention they need when they are in dire situations.
